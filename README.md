## Data Description

All data used in this study are publicly available environmental and meteorological observations collected between **2014 and 2025**.

The repository includes both the original yearly datasets and the processed datasets used for model training and evaluation. Raw air quality and meteorological records are provided in year-wise files, while merged and cleaned datasets are supplied for direct reproducibility.

The file **ALL.xlsx** represents the final unified dataset used across all benchmark models reported in the paper. It integrates air quality indicators, meteorological variables, and derived AQI values following the Chinese Ambient Air Quality Index standard (HJ 633–2012).
